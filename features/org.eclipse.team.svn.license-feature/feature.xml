<feature
      id="org.eclipse.team.svn.license"
      version="1.0.0.I20120601-1700">

   <license url="license.html">
      %license
   </license>

</feature>
<!--
Usage:
	- remove license.html and epl-v10.html from all the features
	- remove these files from the build.properties
	- remove 'license' property from a feature.properties files
	- add attributes license-feature="org.eclipse.team.svn.license" and license-feature-version="1.0.0.I20120601-1700" into the <feature> tag like this:
			<feature
			      id="org.eclipse.team.svn.core"
			      label="%featureName"
			      version="1.0.0.I20120601-1700"
			      provider-name="%providerName"
			      plugin="org.eclipse.team.svn.core"
			      license-feature="org.eclipse.team.svn.license"
			      license-feature-version="1.0.0.I20120601-1700">
Benefits? We have 10 features and 20 copies of license files, so if we were to reduce their amount just to 1 copy, then it will greatly reduce our chances of mistakes while updating these files.			      
Why introduction of the license feature is delayed? It could only be built with 3.7 which still is not released yet and is not ready for development.
