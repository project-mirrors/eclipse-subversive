<h3>Extracting changes</h3>
	<p>The extract action was provided to help people who want to apply the changes on the resource to some location. You can use it
	when you need to. The changes are applied with respect to the hierarchical structure of the selection.
	If the change is the deletion, than the existing resource in the location with the same path will be deleted.
	Others will be replaced if exist.</p>
	<b>Synchronize View 'Extract...' and 'Extract All...' actions</b>
	<p>In Synchronize View you have a probability to extract local changes, remote changes or both.
	<br/>Using local extracting will apply your local changes comparatively to the base revision to the specified location.
	Using the remote one will apply the incoming changes to the specified location. 'Extract All' action provides a probability
	to apply both local and incoming changes, but the resources marked as conflicted will be ignored.</p>
	<b>History View 'Extract...' action</b>
	<p>In History View extracting is possible when two remote revisions are selected. The changes are gathered between the selected
	revisions and applied to the specified location.</p>
