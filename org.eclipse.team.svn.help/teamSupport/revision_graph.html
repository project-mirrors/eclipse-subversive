<h2>SVN Revision Graph</h2>
    <i>'SVN Revision Graph'</i> is a graphical representation of history for any resource. Using Revision Graph we can see a resource history with copy operation, applied for this resource. Represented information includes information about branches and tags for resource, so it allows to see a revision history for a resource and all its branches and tags. It's a main advantage of the Revision Graph over a History View, because History View is able to display only a history for resource, but not its copies. As the result Revision Graph is very useful in case if branches and tags are used, so users can see the whole picture of resource changes together with all branches and tags, where it was used on the one screen.

    <b>Revision Graph features:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Displaying of the revision graph for resource</li>
		<li>Switching between compact and full data representation (In compact view revision with no copy operations are filtered out. Full data representation displays all revisions)</li>
		<li>Supported actions for displayed revisions: compare revisions, show content, export content, display history and other operations, available for History View (the same list of actions is available in the revision Graph)</li>
		<li>Graph zooming and thubnailing in Outline view</li>
		<li>Expanding/collapsing revisions</li>
	</ul>
