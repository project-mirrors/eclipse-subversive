<h3>Subversive update instructions</h3>
	<b>If the user has previously installed Subversive from eclipse.org update site</b>
	<p>The user is able to update Subversive using Eclipse update manager and the same steps as for <a href="install.html">installation procedure</a>. The only difference is skipping steps 3 and 4 (<a href ="install.html#new_update_sites">creating new update sites</a>) and ignoring <a href="install.html#migrate">migrating projects and settings</a> in step 11.</p>
	<b>If the user has previously installed Subversive from polarion.org update site</b>
	<p>The user is able to update Subversive using Eclipse update manager and the same steps as for <a href="install.html">installation procedure</a>. But the user shouldn't uninstall his version of plug-in and specify the update sites offered in steps 3 and 4 (<a href ="install.html#new_update_sites">creating new update sites</a>). Also the user should pay attention
	to the <a href="install.html#migrate">migrating projects and settings</a> in step 11. The last is obvious thing to do if the user doesn't want to have his working copy crashed. Then and only after the described steps the user is able to safely uninstall the previous version of Subversive plug-in.</p>
