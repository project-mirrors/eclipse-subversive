	<h2>SVN Connectors Discovery</h2>
	<p>
		Subversive Connector Discovery allows user to easily install SVN Connectors. The main
		problem which Subversive previously had is the overcomplicated procedure of installing:
		<ul> 
			<li>users need to install Subversive from 2 different update sites: first for SVN Team Provider and second for SVN Connectors</li>
			<li>there are many combinations how users can install Subversive and Connectors and some of these combinations are not compatible</li>
		</ul>
		Thanks to Connector Discovery, the procedure of installing was significantly simplified: now users just need to install
		only Subversive SVN Team Provider (without installing SVN connectors from another update site) and then
		on eclipse startup on first calling to any Subversive functionality if there are no connectors installed, Connector discovery
		feature is automatically called.
