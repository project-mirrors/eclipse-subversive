	<h2>Working with Compare Editor</h2>
	<p>Actually there are a lot of examples of situations when it will be comfortable for the user to use Compare Editor. The main and the most frequently met is manual merging of the conflict changes. Then in such editor the user can easily examine all the changes, apply all needed ones, make his own ones  and save the file.</p>
