<h2>Subversion introduction</h2>
<p>
	Subversion&reg; is an open-source version control system. Subversion&reg; allows developers to share their projects on 
	repositories, where they are stored afterwards. A repository is very similar to a file server. The only difference 
	is that it not only stores a copy of the file system, but also its previous states and changing history. Subversion&reg; 
	can be accessed over a network, so it provides the possibility for people to work on shared files and watch for 
	changes made by other developers.</p>
