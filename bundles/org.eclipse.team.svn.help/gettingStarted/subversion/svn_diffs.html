<h3>Main feature differences between SVN and CVS</h3>
<p>
	SVN&reg; in contrast to CVS can track not only file change history, but all the changes in file system of the shared projects,
	allows to add/delete/remove/rename all the shared resources without creating new items and losing information about
	deleted ones. Subversion&reg; uses most improved algorithms to compare both binary and non-binary files. In advance, commit operation
	in SVN&reg; is absolutely atomic and versioned properties support is available. And at last, owing to well-defined API, SVN&reg; is
	maintainable and usable by other applications.
