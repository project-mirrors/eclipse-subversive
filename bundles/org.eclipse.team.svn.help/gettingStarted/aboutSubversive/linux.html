<h3>Note for Linux users</h3>
	<p>The SVN Connectors' plug-in doesn't contain binaries of JavaHL library for Linux OS.
	So if you want to use the JavaHL connector to access SVN, you should build the
	library by yourself or install the pre-built one from the software repository.</p>
	<p>Also you should pay special attention to the fact, that JVM uses the value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to look for the libraries to load.
	So the path to the JavaHL binaries must be included here as well, otherwise you'll have to edit your <i>eclipse.ini</i> file to let the JVM know of the actual place.</br>
	In order to do so you just need to add the following line to eclipse.ini after the "-vmargs" line: "-Djava.library.path=<i>input here the path to the library</i>".</br></p>
